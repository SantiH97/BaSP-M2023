# Become a Software Professional 2023.
## Roadmap.
#### Week 02.
```
I made the basic markup of the page, beside the "<!DOCTYPE> setup", it contains a body with a header, an aside section with a nav for the side bar, a main section subdivided in section tags with a form as well as all the images and text found in the original project, and lastly, a footer with copiright information and fuctioning social media icons.
```
#### Week 03.
```
I added a CSS folder wich includes a reset file and a styles.css with all the styles found in the original figma page all of which are presented by order of appearance.
```
#### Week 04.
```
I improved upon the previous design making it responsive mostly through the use of percentages and Flexbox. It now works on devices of all shapes and sizes.
```
#### Week 05.
```
I provided my solutions to six sets of problems cocerning javaScript. This are divided into six .js stand-alone files linked together by an index.html file
```
#### Week 06.
```
I added the sign up and log in pages to the week-04 project as well as its corresponding javaScript validations.
```
#### Week 07.
```
By means of an API I set out my now valid data, managed to log in a single server registered user and stored the sign up information in local storage as well as handled any possible server-side error.
```
## Contents.
This BaSp folder contains several sub-folders pertaining to each individual week. on the latest version (week-07) we have a views folder with three .html pages (sign up, log in and main) for each of those we have their corresponding css files as well as two resets and a few global.css files. Each view file has a corresponding .js as well which handles their input validations and sets and removes classes for their html elements.
