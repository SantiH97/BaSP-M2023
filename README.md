# Become a Software Professional 2023.
## Week 02.
I made the basic markup of the page, beside the "<!DOCTYPE> setup", it contains a body with a header, an aside section with a nav for the side bar, a main section subdivided in section tags with a form as well as all the images and text found in the original project, and lastly, a footer with copiright information and fuctioning social media icons.
## Week 03.
I added a CSS folder wich includes a reset file and a styles.css with all the styles found in the original figma page all of which are presented by order of appearance.
## Week 04.
I improved upon the previous design making it responsive mostly through the use of percentages and Flexbox. It now works on devices of all shapes and sizes.
